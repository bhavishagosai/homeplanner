<p>Everybody knows the power of colours. They not only change the mood but also have therapeutic powers. Feng Shui practitioners believe that if colours are used according to a set prescription, they have the ability to bring positive vibes into the home.</p>

<p><strong>So, paint your walls accordingly and bring luck, positive energy and cheer into your abode.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Red</strong></p>

<p>In Feng Shui, the colour red denotes the fire element. You can use this colour on the walls of the living room, dining room, kitchen, gym, etc. In your child&rsquo;s room, employ this colour with care. Use this colour in the east, southeast, west and northwest areas of your home. Do not use this colour as the dominant shade in the bedroom as it is a very powerful colour.</p>

<p>Add red to a room if you are tired, feel low or are suffering from anaemia because it is a colour of passion and high energy. Use it in balance with calm colours.</p>

<p><strong>Orange</strong></p>

<p>Optimist orange also denotes the fire element. Use of this colour increases productivity, enthusiasm, and pleasure. Orange colour keeps you lively and playful, so it will be a good choice to use this colour in your living room or the children&rsquo;s play zones.</p>

Feng Shui practitioners say this colour enhances lively conversations and good times in your home. It is a mixture of red and yellow, so it has the quality of both the colours, the energy of red and the cheerfulness of yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Purple</strong></p>

<p>This royal colour is also associated with the fire element in Feng Shui, so you can paint the walls of your meditation room with this colour as it creates the perfect atmosphere for some quiet introspection.</p>

<p>If you want to colour the walls with purple, go for light tones such as lavender or light violet, but restrict this colour only to the east, west and south-east areas. Use purple or violet shades in a bedroom for a soothing and restful sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Pink</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />
Another fire element in Feng Shui is pink. It creates a calm environment, so if you have problems sleeping, paint the walls of your bedroom in a light shade of pink. Pink brings strong positive energy into your environment.</p>

<p><strong>Yellow</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />
Mood-lifting yellow is another colour that belongs to the fire element. However, its light shades belong to the earth element. In Feng Shui, yellow is the centre of everything, comparable with the Sun which is the ultimate source of positive energy. You can use this colour in any room as this colour has the power of adaptability, flexibility, clarity, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Green</strong></p>

<p>The balancing and restful qualities of green make it popular for the living room and the bedroom. This colour is associated with the wood element. It reduces stress and has the quality of healing.</p>

<p><strong>Blue</strong></p>

<p>In Feng Shui, blue is associated with the control of negative emotions and denotes the water element. It also reduces stress and tension in life. Avoid too much blue on the walls if you have frequent mood swings.</p>

<p><strong>White and grey</strong></p>

<p>Grey, white, and silver colours belong to the metal element, which should figure dominantly in the west and north-west directions of your home. Avoid the use of too much gray on the walls as this can lead to a drop in mood and energy. If you want to go employ white as the dominant colour, you can comfortably do so as white is associated with purity and cleanliness.</p>
