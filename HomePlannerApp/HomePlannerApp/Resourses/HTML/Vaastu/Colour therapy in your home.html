<p>Everybody knows the power of colours; colours not only change the mood but also have therapeutic powers. Feng shui practitioners believe that if colours are used according to a set prescription, they have the ability to bring positive vibes into the home.</p>

<p><strong>So, paint your walls accordingly and bring luck, positive energy, and cheer into your abode.</strong></p>

<p>In feng shui, red colour denotes the fire element. One can use this colour on the walls of the living room, dining room, kitchen, gym, etc. In your child&rsquo;s room, use this colour tactfully. Use this colour in the east, southeast, west and northwest areas of your home. Do not use this colour in dominant form in the bedroom, as it is a very powerful colour.</p>

<p>Add red to a room if you are tired, depressed, suffering from anaemia because it is a colour of passion and high energy. One should use this colour very carefully, as it denotes the fire element in feng shui, which should be used in balance.</p>

<p>Optimist orange also denotes the fire element. Use of this colour increases productivity, enthusiasm, and pleasure. Orange colour keeps you lively and playful, so it will be a great feng shui choice if you use this colour in your living room or the kids&rsquo; play zones.</p>

<p>Feng shui practitioners say this colour enhances lively conversations and good times in your home. This colour is a mixture of red and yellow, so it has the quality of both the colours. That is love of red and wisdom of yellow.</p>

<p>Purple colour is also associated with the fire element in feng shui, so you can paint the walls of your meditating room with this colour as it creates a perfect atmosphere for meditation. If you want to colour the walls with purple colour, go for its much lighter tone like lavender or light violet, but restrict this colour only in east, west and southeast areas.</p>

<p>Use purple or violet shades in a bedroom to make your sleep soothing and restful. Another fire element in feng shui is pink colour. It creates calm environment&mdash;so if you have sleeping disorders, paint the walls of your bedroom with the lighter shade of pink. Pink brings strong positive energy into your environment.</p>

<p>Mood-lifting yellow is another colour that belongs to the fire element; but the lighter shades of yellow belong to the earth element. In feng shui, yellow is the centre of everything as it is compared to the qualities of the Sun, which is the ultimate source of positive energy. You can use this colour in any room as this colour has the power of adaptability, flexibility, clarity, etc.</p>

<p>The balancing and restful qualities in green colour make it popular for the living room and the bedroom. This colour is associated with the wood element; it reduces stress and has the quality of healing. So, next time, do not wonder if you see this colour in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>

<p>In feng shui blue is associated with the control of negative emotions and denotes the water element. It also reduces stress and tension in life-but avoid too much blue on the walls if your mood swings a lot.</p>

<p>Gray, white, and silver colours belong to the metal element, which dominate the west and northwest direction of your house.</p>

<p>Avoid the use of too much gray on the walls as more use of this colour causes depression. So, use colours on the walls and bring good luck and positive energy into your home this festival season.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to go white all over, you cannot possibly want anything more&mdash;white is associated with purity and cleanliness.</p>
