<p>A well is a critical source of water for many homes. Many even depend entirely on the water from a well. Vaastu has some guidelines pertaining to digging and location of this water source.</p>

<p><strong>PRINCIPLES FOR A WELL</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here are some basic guidelines:</strong></p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction of a new house should begin with the well.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; It is believed to be auspicious if water from this well is used for the construction of the house.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The well or water source should ideally be located in the north or north-east of the site.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; If you draw a line from the south-east corner to the north-east corner, the well should be to the right or left of the line, not on it.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The well can also be in the north or east sides of the property.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The well should not be in the north-west or southeast corners. This is believed to be inauspicious. It is especially inauspicious if the well is dug in the south-west corner. It is also inauspicious to have a well in the middle of a house.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; A well should be round. Ideally, the water in it should be exposed to sunlight for five hours a day. Sharing a well between two houses is not recommended.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The well should be dug after puja has been performed on the land at an auspicious time.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; It should preferably be dug on an auspicious day &ndash; Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. A well should preferably be dug during a downward-facing constellation or star such as Krittika, Purva Phalguni, Mula, Bharani, Ashlesha, Purva Bhadrapada or Purvashadha.</p>
