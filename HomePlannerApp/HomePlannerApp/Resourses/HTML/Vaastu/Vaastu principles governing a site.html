<p>Vaastu has many guidelines on the shape of a residential site. It is believed that a house built on a site that has a recommended shape brings peace and prosperity to the residents.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some</strong> <strong>guidelines:</strong></p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, the shape of a residential site should be square or rectangular.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; If the plot is not a perfect rectangle, at least the southwest and southeast sides should be at a 90 degree angle from each other.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The South-west side of the q u a d r i l at e r a l should definitely not be extended past the southeast side, even if that means not acquiring a portion of the plot.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; A site that extends past the North-east side of the quadrilateral is believed to lead to wealth, happiness, and fame for the residents.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; An extension on any other side is inauspicious.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; An extension on the North-west side is believed to cause loss of wealth and peace.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not auspicious if the land is cut in a corner. If possible, some land to fill in the missing corner should be acquired.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; It is not auspicious if the land is cut short on the North-east side.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; A round, oval, or triangular plot is not recommended.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; L-shaped plots are also inauspicious.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; It is good if a plot is narrow at the entrance and wider at its rear, but the opposite is not good.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; A house should not be built in the shape of a diamond, with the corner facing the North.</p>
